        <h1>Introduction to Blockchain</h1>
     
        <h2>
            Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology revolutionizing industries by securely recording and verifying transactions. It offers transparency, security, and efficiency without the need for intermediaries, making peer-to-peer transactions seamless and cost-effective. With its potential to transform various sectors, blockchain represents a future of decentralized and transparent systems.

     <h3> Key elements of a blockchain </h3>

   <div class="flexbox-lists">
      <div>
      <h4>Distributed ledger technology </h4>
      <p> All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions. With this shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort that’s typical of traditional business networks. </p>
      
          
              

</div>

    
<div>
    <h4>Each block is connected to the ones before and after it </h4>
    <p> These blocks form a chain of data as an asset moves from place to place or ownership changes hands. The blocks confirm the exact time and sequence of transactions, and the blocks link securely together to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.</p>
        
    

</div>

<div>
    <h4> Smart contracts</h4>
    <p>To speed transactions, a set of rules that are called a smart contract is stored on the blockchain and run automatically. A smart contract defines conditions for corporate bond transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more.</p>

    <h3>How blockcahin works</h3>
    <div class="card">
        <h2>As each transaction occurs, it is recorded as a “block” of data</h2>
        <p>Those transactions show the movement of an asset that can be tangible (a product) or intangible (intellectual). The data block can record the information of your choice: who, what, when, where, how much. It can even record the condition, such as the temperature of a food shipment.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="card">
<h2>Each block is connected to the ones before and after it</h2>
<p>These blocks form a chain of data as an asset moves from place to place or ownership changes hands. The blocks confirm the exact time and sequence of transactions, and the blocks link securely together to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between two existing blocks.</p> 
</div>

   <div class="card">
    <i class="fas fa-car"></i>
    <h2>Transactions are blocked together in an irreversible chain: a blockchain</h2>
    <p>Each additional block strengthens the verification of the previous block and hence the entire blockchain. Rendering the blockchain tamper-evident, delivering the key strength of immutability. Removing the possibility of tampering by a malicious actor, and builds a ledger of transactions you and other network members can trust.</p>
